# verser
Generate and search database of verse-cited documents

## Concept

"Verse-cited documents" are those with a hierarchical 
structure.  They're the ones that people cite 
chapter-and-verse from.  

This project will generates SQLite representations of them 
and provide a CLI to conveniently search their contents 
and use citations from them.
